    "I am currently also taking COGS14B, which is a course focused on statistical analysis methods, including but not limited to methods for analyzing bivariate data, such as the well-known Student's t-test, z-test, and such. I thought it would benefit my understanding of materials from both courses if I were able to break down the logic of those statistical analysis methods and build them back, line by line, into a fully-functional Python program. I will hereby present my work below:"

You then draw a convenience sample of 10 students, who are all in your study group, and you are interested in whether your group has performanced significantly different from the class on average since you guys attended the same review session and together created the same cheat sheet. What you collected at hand is a sample mean score of 86%, and luckily knowing these four data--population mean, population standard deviation, sample mean, and sample size--is enough for performing a z-test to answer your question."
